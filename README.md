# og_gain_loss_cnidaria
This project aims to increase our understanding of genomic mechanisms that lead to the evolution of complex traits in Cnidaria. 

# Data: 
- Proteomes of 72 cnidarians, 3 ctenophores, 6 sponges, Trichoplax, and 15 bilaterians
- Single cell RNA sequencing data from _Hydra vulgaris_, _Aurelia coerulea_, _Xenia sp._, _Nematostella vectensis_, and _Acropora millepora_

# Objectives: 
1. Determine orthogroup gains and losses within Cnidaria and summarize the overall functions that were gained and lost at focal nodes.
2. Examine the expression patterns of orthogroups gained at focal nodes in extant species.
3. Identify gains and losses of Gene Expression Programs within Cnidaria and visualize their expression in extant species.
4. Investigate the sequences of gene gain and loss that led to the origin and diversification of cnidocytes.
